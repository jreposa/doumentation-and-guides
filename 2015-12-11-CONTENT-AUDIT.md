# CONTENT AUDIT

* What content types currently exist? Is there news, staff profiles, resources, ebooks, videos, or product pages?

* Where is content feeding into the site from? Is content from an RSS feed appearing on the site?

* Is some content out of your control? Are there any constraints around its accuracy, format, or availability? For example, are there financial services regulations on site content?

* How much content will the new navigation need to handle? Will you be streamlining the existing navigation content or adding to it?

* Has the existing team been able to maintain the content and site sections that already exists? Don't necessarily trust your client?s response here. When was the blog last updated? What about the news area? Which authors are active and inactive? Has any content not been updated since the site last launched?

* What content is or has been popular? If the brand has analytics setup, it's worth checking the numbers yourself to validate this with data. Nobody can argue with the numbers.
