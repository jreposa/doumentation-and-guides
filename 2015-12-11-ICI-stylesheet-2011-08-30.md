**ICI Style Guide**

**Filenaming**

When you're naming Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and PDF files, please do NOT include spaces in the filename. Also avoid symbols such as ()<>[]/~ and extra periods. This is especially important if you?re passing on a document to be posted online. Having a nonstandard filename can cause problems and generate error messages or weird formatting.

Best way to name a file is to keep it simple and short. Changing the date every time you update the file helps keep track of versions.

Oregon-HigherEd-2013-04-08.docx

Oregon-HigherEd-2013-04-08.xlsx

Oregon-HigherEd-2013-04-08.pdf

Note that hyphens and underscores are fine to include.

Make sure that you update the filename every time you send an edited file to a team member or to the web team. It gets really hard to track multiple files with the same name. Adding the date and your initials is a big help.

**Formatting for the Web**

Use **straight quotes** ( " " ), not curly quotes ( " " ). You can fix this in your Word Preferences under AutoCorrect.

Select different **header styles** using Word. Go to View and then to Styles (this may differ depending on your version of Word, but there should be the option under Styles to create Header 1, Header 2, etc.). Please don't try to fake this by inserting larger text, boldfacing, different fonts, etc. The web guys will just have to strip all that out.

Use **one font per document**. Doesn't matter what font, just don't switch around.

To make **bullets**, select the text you want to be bulleted. Then go to Format / Bullets and Numbering, and click on the bullets. Again, please don't try to do this manually by inserting hyphens, tabs, etc.

Use the Table function in Word to create **tables**. Please don't draw text boxes and fill in text.

**Don't underline for emphasis**. Online, an underline means something is a link. Use boldface or ital for emphasis instead.

Speaking of links, the most accessible practice (and the best to show up in Google results) is to have your link describe what it is, rather than saying "click here." For example:

Don't do this: To see our spring 2013 courses, click here.

Do this: Our course catalog for spring 2013 is now available.

If you're sending the web team **edits to a website**, please include the URL so they know what page or pages you're referring to. If you're editing a bunch of text, use Track Changes to show the web team exactly what changes you're requesting.

Don't use an **em-dash (?)** for online writing. It messes up code. Use two hyphens instead (--). Word may autocorrect those to a dash, but you can fix that in Preferences / AutoCorrect.

Same goes for **ellipses (?)**. Word autoformats them unless you turn that off under Preferences / AutoCorrect. Or just add spaces to avoid autoformatting: . . .

If you're including **images** on your website, the web team will love you forever if you include **brief descriptions** for readers who are blind. (If you don't, the web team will write descriptions, but they don't have the background knowledge you do about the photo subjects. So your descriptions will be more helpful.)

**Person-First Language**

Person-first language is a way of talking to and about people with disabilities. It puts the person first, not the disability. 

In all ICI publications and products, we use this type of language. Here are some examples.

Don't say: "Joshua is **a disabled man**."

Better way to say it: "Joshua **has a disability." **

Even better way to say it: "Joshua** has cerebral palsy** and **uses a communication device**."

Why is the last one the best? Well, it's more specific, and doesn?t reduce Joshua to a label.

Don't say: "Ms. Ferrara is **confined to a wheelchair**" or ?Ms. Ferrara is **wheelchair-bound**.?

Do say: "Ms. Ferrara **uses a wheelchair**."

Why? The first two phrases sound negative, while the preferred one is neutral.

Don't say: "It?s easier for **the deaf** to watch a movie if it has captioning."

Do say: "It's easier for **deaf people** to watch a movie if it has captioning."

Why? Talking about *the blind, the deaf*, or *the disabled* reduces people to a faceless group. Talking about them as *people* helps avoid this.

**Tips for Articles**

Reference guides: 

*APA Style Guide*

*Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary*

*Chicago Manual of Style*

Check the websites of those publications to identify the latest edition. If you don't have it, ask your supervisor about ordering a copy for you or your team.

References should always be in APA style. For tables, headers, and other article features, refer to the guidelines of the journal you're submitting to.

Format documents with 1" margins in twelve-point font. Single-space paragraphs unless the journal you're targeting needs something else (be sure to ask).

Block quotes are indented 1" from the body text and are single-spaced (even if the rest of the article uses larger spacing). Use for all direct quotations of 40 words or longer.

Keep a close eye on consistency. All headers of the same valence should have the same style (sentence or title case). 

**Grant Proposals**

There is boilerplate language you can use for your grant proposals on the Marketing and Communication Team's website:

http://www.icizilla.org/help-yourself

It's under "Documents and Forms."

**General Grammar and Spelling Rules**

Incluce **hyphens **when needed. Examples: disability-specific support, three-plus years. 

Note that hyphenation depends on sentence structure:

The ICI offers employment training. (no hyphen)

The ICI has created a new employment-training center. (Hyphen needed, since "employment-training" is an adjective here, describing the center.)

There are a few terms that never get hyphenated, even when it would be correct to. These are part of the disabilities field, and look weird to people when hyphenated. So, DON'T hyphenate:

*technical assistance*

*developmental disability/disabilities*

*vocational rehabilitation*

*health care*

*mental health*

**Acronyms**: If a term is used repeatedly, add the acronym the first time the phrase appears in body text (not in a header), and then use the acronym thereafter:

The National Institute on Disability Rehabilitation and Research (NIDRR) funds our research. The opinions in this paper are those of the authors, not of NIDRR. 

Use only **one space** after a period. 

Use a **comma** after the second-to-last item in a series: 

water, lemon, and mint

In a **title**, capitalize the second part of a hyphenated word:

Part-Time Work Succeeds

Be consistent with your **bullets**. Either make them all complete sentences (ending with periods), or fragments (with no periods at the end). Don't end bullets with commas or semicolons, and don't end the second-to-last bullet with "and." 

Do not put **spaces** outside **slashes or dashes**. 

either/or

256?1100

Yes?that's it!

An en-dash (?) is longer than a hyphen (-), but shorter than an em-dash (?). Here's how to use these dashes:

Use a **hyphen** (-) when you're connecting two words.

The governor made a speech about wheelchair-accessible buildings in our city.

Use an **en-dash** (?) to separate dates and page ranges:

1970?2015

pp. 226?304

Use an **em-dash** (?) to set off text you want to emphasize or separate:

In the disability field?a hotbed of drama?there's always something new in store.

Take our online class?but make sure to register by June 15th.

(in a header or title:) Vocational Rehabilitation?New Strategies

But be aware that em-dashes mess up websites. So if you're **writing something for a website, use a double hyphen:**

Take our online class -- but make sure to register by June 15th.

Check your journal articles for** tense consistency**. Be sure not to switch back and forth between present and past tense.

Go ahead and use **third-person plural** in lieu of awkward third-person singular constructions such as *him/her*, *he or she*, etc.

Service providers often struggle to get paid an adequate wage for **their** important work.

Ask the job seeker what works best for **them**.

Yeah, that second example isn't really grammatically correct, but it's much friendlier than writing *him/her, she/he,* etc.

**Lowercase** wherever possible, especially when using generic terms: 

The executive director is traveling this week.

The institute is hiring new job coaches.

Check with your disability-services provider to learn more."

Do **capitalize** names and official titles: 

She got her master's degree from the College of Human Development at UC Santa Cruz.

Gary works for the Advancement Institute.

The One-Stop Career Center is open today.

**Punctuation goes inside quotation marks** if it's a period or comma, **outside** if it?s an exclamation mark or question mark:

I just read a book called "The Elements of Style."

Have you read "The Elements of Style"?

**Frequent Points of Confusion**

**i.e. vs. e.g.**

*i.e.* means *that is* or *which is*: 

?the nonprofit's mission, **i.e.,** helping people find better jobs.

*e.g.* means *for example*: 

?the nonprofit's activities, **e.g.,** running training sessions and conducting employment research.

**Don't forget the comma** after *i.e.* and *e.g.*!

**cf.** 

*cf.* does not mean *see also*; it means *compare to*. Usually better just to use *see* instead:

Research has shown that reading to young children helps them achieve literacy at earlier ages (**see** Carrera, 1998).

**ensure vs. insure vs. assure**

*ensure* means *to make sure of*: 

Turning your survey in on time will **ensure** that your vote is counted.

*insure* means *to protect using a plan*: 

I will **insure** my house against floods and fires.

*assure* means *to tell someone that something will happen or is true*: 

She **assures** me that the conference will go ahead as planned.

**compliment vs. complement**

To *compliment* means *to speak positively of*: 

Julio **complimented** Lily on her presentation.

To *complement* means *to fit together or go together well*: 

Lily's analytical skills and Julio?s people skills **complement** each other.

**effect vs. affect**

An *effect* is something that happens as a result of something else: 

The **effect** of this intervention was that health-care providers learned more about disability.

To *affect* something is to change it or have an impact on it: 

This training will **affect** clinicians' attitude toward their patients.

Confusingly, *to effect change* means to make a change happen. And let's not get into clinical terms like *affective disorder.*

**Good general rule: Use ****_effect_**** as a noun and ****_affect _****as a verb.**

**Jargon to Avoid**

**stakeholders**?This term is overused and vague, generally meaning something like *participants* or *people who care about what we're doing*. It?s often possible to avoid it; if you can?t resist using it, explain who these stakeholders are:

"We held a meeting in Sacramento for the project's **stakeholders**. They included state-agency representatives, employment-services professionals, and people with intellectual disabilities and their families."

**at-risk youth**?At risk of what? This is a wimpy way to say "poor inner-city kids." Again, be as specific as you can:

Don't say: "The project is designed to assist **at-risk youth**."

Do say: "The project's goal is to help teenagers in impoverished neighborhoods stay in high school and find college scholarships."

**capacity-building**?This term doesn't mean much outside the nonprofit world. Better to say what your project is really doing: 

Don't say: "Our organization **builds capacity** at employment-service provider agencies."

Do say: "We support employment-service provider agencies to train their staff in the following areas: ? This enables the agencies to serve a wider range of customers."

**strategic plan**?All plans are strategic. Just say *plan.*

**action plan**?All plans involve taking action. Just say *plan.*

**best practices**?This is another term that's overused in the nonprofit world, the social-services arena, and even the corporate sphere. As with *stakeholders*, if you must use it, explain what you mean:

Don't say: "We?re training primary-school teachers on **best practices** for inclusive teaching."

Do say: "We're training primary-school teachers on **how to** improve literacy among all their students?including those from low-income households, those with disabilities, and those for whom English is a second language."

**impactful**?This is not a real word!

Don't say: "Her presentation about cerebral palsy **was very impactful** for her listeners."

Do say: "Her presentation about cerebral palsy **made a strong impact** on her listeners."

**leverage**?When used as a verb, this is not a real word!

Don't say: "We can help your agency to **leverage** social media."

Do say: "We can help your agency to **use** social media" OR ?We can help your agency to **take advantage of** social media? OR ?We can help your agency to **use the power of** social media.?
